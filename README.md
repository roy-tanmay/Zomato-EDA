# Zomato Dataset EDA

This project is my first **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** practice on the Zomato dataset.  
The goal of this analysis was to explore the data, clean it, and generate insights.

## 📊 Steps I Performed
- Handled missing values  
- Performed basic statistical analysis  
- Visualized important features using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**   

## 🔑 Key Insights
1. India has the **largest market share (94%)**, followed by the USA and UK.  
2. Only **India and the UAE** have online delivery options available.    

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Try feature engineering  
- Build simple machine learning models (classification/regression)  
- Share more datasets and projects on GitHub & Kaggle  

## ✨ About Me
I am a data science aspirant currently learning machine learning and practicing EDA.
This project is part of my practice and portfolio building.
